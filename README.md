Built an interactive Streamlit dashboard analyzing Formula 1 race sessions (2020–2025) using the FastF1 API, Matplotlib, and Pandas. The dashboard enables dynamic exploration of race dynamics with three key visual modules:

## Race Position Tracker:
Visualizes real-time driver position changes per lap with overlays for safety cars, red flags, and VSC periods.

## Tyre Strategy Analyzer: 
Displays stint durations and compound usage per driver with rainfall overlays, offering insights into pit strategies and weather impact.

## Lap Time Comparison: 
Charts lap-time evolution and performance consistency across selected drivers using quick-lap filtering.
## Cache:
Integrated caching for faster loading and FastF1’s styling utilities for driver-specific colors and tyre compounds. Designed to make complex telemetry data visually intuitive and accessible for fans and analysts alike.
